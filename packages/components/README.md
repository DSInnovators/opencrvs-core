## Running the styleguide

```
yarn start
```

to launch project with nodemon running.

## Making changes to the styleguide

During development to add new styles, create a module in the components folder, and then run the following command to build the module into the lib directory:

```
yarn build
```

To then use the component in development of OpenCRVS, you will need to re-install all dependencies by running this command in the OpenCRVS application root directory:

```
yarn --force
```

The component will not be available to other developers until a successful pull request has been merged into master and the style been submitted to NPM.
